# Hello-World
Start of GitHub

I am a beginer of programming, and I used to using C++ to write codes. However, my programming skills are terrible. Therefore, I want to improve myself in both writting programs and reading others' excellent codes. BTW, I recently started learning Python and Machine Learning, hope I can learn it quickly and well.
